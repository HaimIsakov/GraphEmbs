## Unsupervised Network Embeddings for Graph Visualization, Clustering and Classification


In this work we provide an unsupervised approach to learn embedding representation for a collection of graphs so that it can be used in numerous graph mining tasks. By using an unsupervised neural network approach on input graphs, we aim to capture the underlying distribution of the data in order to discriminate between different class of networks. Our method is assessed empirically on
synthetic and real life datasets and evaluated in three different tasks: graph clustering, visualization and classification. 

This code was tested on Debian GNU/Linux 8.11 (jessie), python 3.0
